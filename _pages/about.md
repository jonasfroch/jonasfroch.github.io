👨🏻‍💻 I’m a second-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Cologne, specializing in **Sports Economics**

🔬 My research focuses on exploring both the tangible and intangible effects of professional sports teams, facilities, and major sporting events. Specifically, I aim to understand the market idiosyncrasies that position sports facilities and teams as valuable urban amenities.

📊 Further, my experience in sports data analytics at **Impect** sparked my passion for leveraging the unique nuances of sports data to test behavioral insights and economic theories, uncovering patterns and drawing informed conclusions.

I’m always excited to chat about new ideas. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to exchange thoughts, don’t hesitate to get in touch!

# 📚 Teaching
I recently taught a hands-on project course for undergraduate Economics students called **Empirical Replications in Sports Economics**. In this course, we dive into the world of sports economics and learn how to conduct empirical research by replicating selected papers using R. It’s a great way for students to engage with the material and develop practical skills!

# 🌍 Upcoming Travels
I will be in Boston in November. Hit me up if you would like to grab a coffee!
