👨🏻‍💻 I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Cologne, currently visiting Boston University.

🔬 My research focuses on exploring both the tangible and intangible effects of professional sports teams, facilities, and major sporting events. Specifically, I aim to understand the market idiosyncrasies that position sports facilities and teams as valuable urban amenities.

📊 Further, my experience in sports data analytics at **Impect** sparked my passion for leveraging the unique nuances of sports data to test behavioral insights and economic theories.

🧠 I am affiliated with the Center for Social and Economic Behavior ([C-SEB](https://c-seb.de/en/)) at the University of Cologne.

## Collaborations
I’m always excited to chat about new ideas. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to exchange thoughts, don’t hesitate to get in touch!

# 📚 Teaching
I recently taught a hands-on project course for undergraduate Economics students called **Empirical Replications in Sports Economics**. In this course, we dive into the world of sports economics and learn how to conduct empirical research by replicating selected papers using R. It’s a great way for students to engage with the material and develop practical skills!

# 🌍 Upcoming Travels
I will visit Prof. Daniele Paserman at Boston University this fall/spring. Hit me up if you would like to grab a coffee!
