👨🏻‍💻 I’m a first-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Cologne, specializing in **Sports Economics**

🔬 My research focuses on exploring both the tangible and intangible effects of professional sports teams, facilities, and major sporting events. Specifically, I aim to understand the market idiosyncrasies that position sports facilities and teams as valuable urban amenities.

📊 Further, my experience in sports data analytics at **Impect** sparked my passion for leveraging the unique nuances of sports data to test behavioral insights and economic theories, uncovering patterns and drawing informed conclusions.

## Collaborations
I’m always excited to chat about new ideas. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to exchange thoughts, don’t hesitate to get in touch!

# 📚 Teaching
I recently taught a hands-on project course for undergraduate Economics students called **Empirical Replications in Sports Economics**. In this course, we dive into the world of sports economics and learn how to conduct empirical research by replicating selected papers using R. It’s a great way for students to engage with the material and develop practical skills!

# 🌍 Upcoming Travels
I will be in Boston from 29.05-19.06 and would be happy to meet up. Further, I will present our work "Contingent Employment and Effort: Lessons from Soccer" at the upcoming ESEA Sports Economics Conference in Innsbruck, Ausrria.
