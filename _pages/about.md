👨🏻‍💻 I’m a first-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Cologne, specializing in **Sports Economics**

🔬 My research focuses on exploring both the tangible and intangible effects of professional sports teams, facilities, and major sporting events. Specifically, I aim to understand the market idiosyncrasies that position sports facilities and teams as valuable urban amenities.

## Collaborations
I’m always excited to chat about new ideas. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to exchange thoughts, don’t hesitate to get in touch!

# 📚 Teaching
I currently teach a hands-on project course for undergraduate Economics students called **Empirical Replications in Sports Economics**. In this course, we dive into the world of sports economics and learn how to conduct empirical research by replicating selected papers using R. It’s a great way for students to engage with the material and develop practical skills!
