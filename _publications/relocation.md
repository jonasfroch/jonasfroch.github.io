title: "The Relocation Effect of a Major League Franchise on Residential Property Values"
collection: publications
category: workingpapers
permalink: /publication/relocation
excerpt: 'We exploit the relocation of the NFL’s Rams franchise as a natural experiment to estimate the effect of
residential proximity to sports amenities using difference-in-differences hedonics. For a sample of single-family
homes transacted in St. Louis between 2012 and 2019, we reveal that the relocation has provoked a
significant relative price depreciation of 7.52% in housing values within a three-mile impact area. Subsequent
distance ring analyses show that the effect is dispersed heterogeneously across space and declines in a non-linear
distance-decaying pattern from the former host stadium. We perform a synthetic control analysis and
identify a stagnation in the number of food and accommodation establishments, along with a moderate
decline in retail trade establishments, as an important transmission mechanism underlying the observed
loss in local amenity value. Approximating the aggregate relative housing value depreciation suggests the
Rams generated substantial intangible amenity value, though insufficient to provide a compelling economic
rationale for the generous public subsidization seen in recent decades.'
