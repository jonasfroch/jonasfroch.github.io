I recently provided expert insights on the economic impact of the NFL Germany games. According to a study by The Sports Consultancy 📊, the inaugural game in Munich generated an estimated economic impact of €70.2 million, including €32.2 million in direct spending 💰. Similarly, the Frankfurt games contributed around €110 million, with an additional €8 million in projected sales tax revenue 💸. These figures suggest a notable boost to local economies, especially in cities like Frankfurt, which are less established as major tourist destinations 🌍.

However, while the reported impacts are significant, they should be viewed with caution ⚠️. Academic research consistently shows that ex-ante impact studies—often commissioned by event organizers—tend to overstate the benefits by overlooking factors like crowding-out effects, substitution effects, and economic leakage 🔍. Much of the revenue may flow to international entities such as global hotel chains or the NFL itself 🌐, meaning the local economic benefit could be smaller than reported. While the NFL Germany games likely provided some positive economic impact 🏙️, the true scale of this impact remains unclear and may be lower than initially projected 🤔.
