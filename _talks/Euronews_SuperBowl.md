I recently provided expert insights on the economic impact of the NFL Germany games. According to a study by The Sports Consultancy 📊, the inaugural game in Munich generated an estimated economic impact of €70.2 million, including €32.2 million in direct spending 💰. Similarly, the Frankfurt games contributed around €110 million, with an additional €8 million in projected sales tax revenue 💸. These figures suggest a noteworthy boost to local economies, particularly in cities like Frankfurt, which are less established as major tourist destinations 🌍.

However, while the reported impacts are significant, they should be treated with caution ⚠️. Academic research consistently highlights that ex-ante impact studies—often commissioned by event organizers—tend to overstate the benefits by overlooking key factors like crowding-out effects, substitution effects, and economic leakage 🔍. A significant portion of the revenue may flow to international entities such as global hotel chains or the NFL itself 🌐, which would reduce the local economic benefit. Additionally, while these events are clearly an opportunity for host cities, the long-term, sustainable economic benefits remain unclear and require more independent scrutiny 🧐.

While the NFL Germany games undeniably contributed positively to the local economy 🏙️, it is important to remember that the broader, long-term economic impact often falls short of the more optimistic projections put forward by event promoters 📉. As with many large-scale sporting events, the true economic effects are complex and require more cautious interpretation 🤔
