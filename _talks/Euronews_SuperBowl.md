I recently provided expert insights on the economic impact of the NFL Germany games. According to a study by The Sports Consultancy, the inaugural game in Munich generated an estimated economic impact of €70.2 million, including €32.2 million in direct spending. Similarly, the Frankfurt games contributed around €110 million, with an additional €8 million in projected sales tax revenue. These figures suggest a notable boost to local economies, especially in cities like Frankfurt, which are less established as major tourist hubs.

However, while the reported impacts are significant, they should be viewed with caution. Academic research consistently shows that ex-ante impact studies, often commissioned by event organizers, tend to overstate the benefits by overlooking factors like crowding-out effects, substitution effects, and economic leakage. Much of the spending may accrue to international firms or the NFL itself. So while the games likely delivered some gains, the true local impact is almost certainly smaller than headline estimates.
