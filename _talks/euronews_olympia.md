It was a pleasure to share my thoughts on Hungary potentially hosting the Olympics in 2036, a topic recently covered by Euronews. I explained that the costs typically far exceed the benefits. Common arguments about the short- and long-term advantages, such as job creation or increased tourism, can be easily refuted and thus fail to provide a direct economic rationale.
While there may be some intangible value, such as boosting the host country's image, it appears questionable whether this alone can justify such immense expenses. More likely, other factors, such as political considerations, drove the interest in hosting major sporting events in recent years.
