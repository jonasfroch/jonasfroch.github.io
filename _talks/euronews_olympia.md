It was a pleasure to share my thoughts on Hungary potentially hosting the Olympics in 2036, a topic recently covered by Euronews 📰. I explained that the costs typically far exceed the benefits 💸. Common arguments about the short- and long-term advantages—such as job creation 👷‍♂️ or increased tourism ✈️—can be easily refuted and thus fail to provide a direct economic rationale 📊.
While there may be some intangible value, such as boosting the host country's image 🌍, it’s questionable whether this alone can justify such immense expenses 🏛️. More likely, other factors, such as political considerations, drove the interest in hosting major sporting events in recent years.
